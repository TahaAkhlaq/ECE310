# ECE310 Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains MATLAB coursework for **ECE310: Digital Signal Processing** at The Cooper Union.

---

## Course Overview

Digital signal processing methods for discrete-time signals and systems, with emphasis on transform-domain analysis and practical filter design and implementation. Topics include discrete-time Fourier analysis, z-domain system characterization, and FIR/IIR filter design workflows validated in MATLAB.

---

## Topics

- Discrete-time signals and LTI systems; convolution and difference equations
- DTFT and DFT; spectral leakage, resolution, windowing, and FFT usage
- z-transform; poles/zeros, ROC concepts (as needed), stability/causality conditions
- Sampling concepts and discrete-time frequency mapping
- FIR filter design: window method, frequency sampling, linear-phase structure
- IIR filter design: analog prototypes (Butterworth/Chebyshev) and bilinear transform
- Filter realizations and numerical considerations (scaling, sensitivity)
- Basic multirate concepts (downsampling/upsampling and anti-alias filtering)
- MATLAB-based design, simulation, and verification
